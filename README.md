# Project Guidelines

## Machine Learning, MDS-MIRI Master 2021-2022

This document contains the guidelines for the practical work (the _project_ ). Please read with care!

### General Information
This project is meant to give you the opportunity to apply the techniques seen during the course to a real-world dataset. The project should cover all aspects of the modelling methodology seen in class from preprocessing to generating a final predictive model together with an assessment of its prediction quality.

The project is to be done in teams of two people. Once you have chosen your partner, the next thing will be to select a dataset to work on. You can choose one from the data repositories we are going to provide to you (see below), or propose your own. In any case, you are expected to hand in two
deliverables:
1. Written report. This document should describe the work carried out, its motivation, the problems
encountered and the solutions found together with the final results and conclusions of your study. More
details follow.
2. Poster or video. The poster should summarize the most important aspects of the project.
Alternatively, you can produce a short video (no more than 3-4 minutes) explaining the most
important parts of your work. All members of the team should participate in the video more or less
equally if you decide to do that.

To carry out your analysis you should use the language python. Remember that there are many useful
packages that extend its basic functionality. Certainly, you can find inspiration in the notebooks from our
weekly laboratory sessions. If you use code or ideas or any kind of resource from elsewhere you should
cite it appropriately. Plagiarism will be prosecuted.

As a first task, you are expected to submit a 1-page project proposal. It should include the composition
of your team, the problem that you are going to work on, the reason why you chose it, together with any
references of previous work on this problem if applicable, and a title for your project; please include
information on the data such as number of rows, columns, and nature of variables (e.g. if categorical, how
many levels).

### Requirements for dataset/problem chosen
1. The dataset of this problem has numerical and categorical variables.
2. The dataset of this problem is not synthetically generated.
3. The dataset of this problem contains more than 10 variables.
4. You need to have enough information about the problem to be able to understand and analyze your
    results. Just getting random data and feeding it to the machine is not valid.
5. Datasets already pre-processed are not valid. You need a problem which data has any
    pre-processing work to do.
6. The dataset of this problem contains more than 200 samples.
7. The problem to solve is not one of the simple known problems like the iris, mnist or wine, etc.

### How and what to submit
The final report should include:

1. A brief description of the work and its goals, data available, and any additional information that you
    may have used.
2. Related previous work (if applicable)
3. The data exploration process, including: pre-processing, feature selection/extraction, visualization,
    clustering, etc.
4. Modeling methods considered, validation protocol and the reasons why the choices were made. 5.
Results obtained with each method used (along with best set of parameters), comparison of results.
6. Final model chosen and an estimation of its generalization performance.
7. Scientific and personal conclusions
8. Possible extensions and known limitations.

Note that the report should not describe explanations seen in class; every table or plot should be
appropriately described. The style of the report should resemble what you encounter in a scientific
publication. Your code should be reproducible; that means using “seeds'' if your code is stochastic.
Make sure you include a variety of linear and non-linear methods seen during the course. All deliveries
are to be made exclusively through the racó. An appropriate mechanism will be prepared for every
delivery. Important: only one member of the team should upload the material For the final delivery,
make sure you include in a compressed file the following:
1. The written report (pdf document). It should not exceed 15 pages; if you need more space, consider
placing the secondary information in a separate appendix file.
2. Any script or code you have used (python notebooks, scripts, or any other code)
3. A flat text file with precise instructions on how to execute and reproduce your results.

### Evaluation
Your final project will be evaluated on the basis of the clarity of your report as well as on its technical
quality. Conditions for a good score are:

1. The appropriate use of techniques and methods seen in class
2. Care and rigor for obtaining results (resampling protocol, quality metrics, etc.)
3. Quality of obtained results (generalization error, simplicity, interpretability)
4. Quality of written report (conciseness, completeness, clarity, appropriate format of report etc.)

Special attention will be given to insights into the results obtained, gaining knowledge on the data
analyzed and obtaining useful conclusions. All experimental decisions should be appropriately justified (on
the resampling protocol or preprocessing, for example). Merely applying the methods to the data and
showing the table of results is not enough, there has to be an interpretation of the results obtained

### The poster or video
Additionally, you are asked to either produce a poster or a video. These are meant to be a summarization
of your work where you briefly explain the most important points from your work (what you have done,
how and why). This will serve as the basis of 15% of your final course grade that corresponds to a
reasoning skill.
